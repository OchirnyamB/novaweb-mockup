# NOVAweb

Initiated by Kevin Cole 2014.06.03

Move along, nothing to see here...

This is currently a static prototype of the NOVA Web Development
site. Eventually, (soon, I hope) it will be converted and merged into
the Django template for the site. However, at present, I prefer to
prototype without all the Django baggage.

The site design is based on a mockup created by Ochirnyam Baasandorj.
